# EmailClassification
This project consists of a variety of data with "spam" and "ham" emails in it. The dataset was cleaned analyzed and trained to detect the emails with the help of machine learning. Two models of Naive Bayes are compared in it,"Gaussian Naive Bayes", and "Multinomial Naive Bayes".

Steps Involved:
- Import Libraries
- Read Data
- Data cleaning and Pre-processing
- Distribution
- Vectorization
- TD-IDF Transformer
- Split data into training (70%) and test(30) data
- Trained the model
- Classification Report and Confusion matrix
